		<p>Tog 24 approached Shark! because they were unhappy with their online sales. Traffic to the site was good but conversion of browsers to purchasers was poor. Working on a consultant basis we reviewed the site and made recommendations about what could be done within budget to improve conversion rates.</p>

		<p>Based on our analysis we were commissioned to photograph the latest winter products for the site using our in-house studio and we were able to provide Tog 24 with a much improved gallery of images including detail shots that replaced less relevant images and targeted their outdoor savvy browsers.</p>

		<p>As a result of the new photography and other changes the product pages were a lot more imformative and easier to browse and as a result Tog 24's online winter sales were uplifted considerably.</p>

		<p>What the client said:</p>

		<p>It was great working with Shark!, they identified and made improvements to our site, and the percentage sales increase spoke for itself.</p>
