		<p>W&amp;L</p>	

		<p>W&amp;L wanted to totally overhaul their brand without losing the integrity of their 100 year old identity. We came up with a creative strategy that used the existing logo in a way that reflected this forward thinking print company's latest direction. We delivered a complete brand solution including an innovative website, stationery and successful email campaign as well as creating two other sub brands aimed at different sectors of the market. <a href="http://www.wlprint.co.uk" title="Waddington &amp; Ledger" onclick="window.open(this.href); return false;">Click here to launch the website.</a></p>
