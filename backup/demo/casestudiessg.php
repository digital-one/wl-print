	<p>Select Group</p>

	<p>When the Select Group of companies grew ten-fold they needed a brand strategy that embraced their growing number of divisions. We developed a flexible identity system that defined each division, maintained the group identity and has the capacity to grow with the Select Group of companies. Alongside the brand strategy we produced all of Select's corporate clothing - from hard wearing fleeces to hard hats, vehicle livery, stationery and brochures. We also created a hard working website which we maintain and optimise on a monthly basis. <a href="http://www.selectconstruction.co.uk/" title="Select Group Yorkshire" onclick="window.open(this.href); return false;">Click here to launch the website.</a></p>

	<p>What the client said:</p>

	<p>We needed to work with someone who could understand our business and advise us on the best way forward. We appointed Shark! and they've been brilliant from start to finish, they have really allowed us to focus on what we're good at, building.</p>
