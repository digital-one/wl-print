		<p>Gateways goes live!</p>

		<p>03.07.08</p>

		<p>After winning the three way pitch only 8 weeks earlier the pressure was on to go live with the new Gateways School website at the end of term exhibition day on 3rd July. Never ones to miss a deadline Shark! launched the site in front of the Headmistress, Chairman of Governors and hundreds of guests on a huge screen - Possibly the biggest website we've ever seen!</p>

		<p>Photography for the site was also provided by Shark! and excited pupils were soon trying to spot themselves on the new site!</p>

		<p>Have a look at the new site at<a href="http://www.gatewaysschool.co.uk" title="Gateways" onclick="window.open(this.href); return false;"> www.gatewaysschool.co.uk</a></p>
