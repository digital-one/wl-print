		<p>Dugdale</p>
	
		<p>Dugdale needed a new approach in order to market their latest range of suit fabric in the Far East. Alongside the team at Dugdale we developed a quintessentially English name, strategy and highly successful range of marketing material that has a real gentleman's club feel. We produced stationery and literature with a foil blocked, hand drawn crest and also developed a patterned, leather outer for the bunch books - something which has never been seen before.</p>

		<p>As well as working with Dugdale on the Thomas Fisher brand we have also helped to launch a sister brand called Joseph Hirst which maintains the traditional typographical flourish.</p>

		<p>What the client said:</p>

		<p>Their attention to detail and their ability to translate ideas and concepts is natural and consistent, transforming our company and it's image.
