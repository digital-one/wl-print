		<p>02.05.08</p>

		<p>Shark! are delighted to be working with Gateways School to design and develop their new website. After a three way pitch we were awarded the project as the school felt our design best reflected the "traditional yet innovative" ethos of the school.</p>

		<p>The large scale of the site required us to develop a unique 'accordian' style menu to keep navigation clear and intuitive. Our visual content management system will allow the school to keep the site up to date with all the latest news and up coming events and our student blog is sure to be a hit with the pupils.</p>

		<p>Now it's heads down to meet the challenging deadline of launching the new site live in front of the Headmistress and guests at the Gateways School Exhibition Day on 3rd July!</p>
